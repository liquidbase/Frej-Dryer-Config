# Frej-Dryer-Config

Configuration file for the Frej dryer

# Description

The configuration file is for the following project on Printables

https://www.printables.com/model/1566113-frej-dryer

This involves the possibility of drying Klipper Filament normally using the PolyDryer box and continuing to dry it during printing.

The whole thing was designed and built by @swemaker (https://www.printables.com/@swemaker) on Printables. I had/have the pleasure of conducting the beta test.
